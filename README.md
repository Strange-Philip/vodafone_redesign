# Vodafone Redesign with Flutter

🎨A flutter ui project inspired by this Ui design by [Might](https://linktr.ee/mightames
).

🔗Here is a link to the 👉🏾[original design on Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/188198965/Homepage-Redesign-of-the-Vodafone-App) .

## 🧪Additions I made to the design:
Added some animations to the project to make it more interesting.

And a little easter egg where when you tap on the logo on the top left corner, the layout is switched...🤫

And oh, added dynamic theming too.🫣

Feel free to clone the project and play around with it.I tried to organize the code as much as possible.
